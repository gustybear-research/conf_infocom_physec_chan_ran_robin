  doi = {10.1109/CNS.2017.8228625},
  abstract = {Due to the broadcast nature of the wireless medium, private communications are easily eavesdropped. This has spurred extensive research into secret key establishment using physical layer characteristics of wireless channels. In all these schemes, the shared secret keys directly originate from the physical features of the real wireless channel, which is highly dependent on the communication environment nearby. Also, previous schemes require performing information reconciliation, which increases both the costs of key establishment and the risk of key leakage over the not yet secured channel. In this paper, we exhibit a novel wireless key establishment method allowing the transmitter to specify arbitrary content as the secret key and cause the receiver to obtain the same key by using a channel manipulation technique. At the same time, eavesdroppers are prevented from deriving the secret key. We furthermore exploit the transmitter's ability to specify any content as the key by enabling the transmitter to apply error-correction code to the key. This means the receiver can automatically detect and correct any mismatched bits without sending key-related information back to the transmitter over the public channel. Experimental results demonstrate that the our key establishment method reaches a success rate as high as 91.0\% for establishing a 168-bit key between the transmitter and the receiver, and meanwhile the chance that the eavesdropper can infer the key in meter-order range of the receiver is subdued into the range of 0∼0.10\%.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider multiple-input singleoutput multi-eavesdropper (MISOME) cognitive radio networks (CRNs), where a secondary user (SU) aims to transmit confidential information to a legitimate SU receiver (SU-RX) in the presence of a primary user (PU) and a multi-antenna passive eavesdropper in fast fading environments. For this system setting, we study beamforming with artificial noise (AN) for the SU to achieve confidential communications. We consider designing an AN-assisted optimal beamforming scheme, denoted cognitive beamforming (CB), that maximizes the ergodic secrecy rate. Moreover, we propose two suboptimal beamforming schemes, namely, scaled beamforming (SB) and projected beamforming (PB). We develop an analytical framework to assess the performance of the proposed schemes in a unified manner. First, we analyze the achievable ergodic secrecy rate of the three schemes. Second, we derive the optimal power allocation for the information and AN signals that maximize the achievable ergodic secrecy rate in the large-antenna regime. Third, we study the performance of the three schemes in terms of the secrecy outage probability. Using numerical simulations, we validate our analytical results and show that CB achieves the best performance among the three proposed schemes. In addition, we provide insights into the effect of various system parameters on the secrecy performance. In particular, we show that the interference threshold at the PU plays an important role in the beamforming design.},

The research community has recognized this theoretical potential and developed architectures [1,2] with large numbers of RF chains. Unfortunately, building the hardware with a large number of RF chains is challenging in practice. CSI data transport and computational overhead of MU-MIMO beamforming can also become prohibitive under large network scale. Furthermore, it is difﬁcult to physically append extra RF chains on existing communication equipments to support such large-scale MU-MIMO architectures.},

  abstract = {Sectorized antennas are a promising class of antennas for enabling direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation and successive transmitter localization. In contrast to antenna arrays, sectorized antennas do not require multiple transceiver branches and can be implemented using a single RF front-end only, thus reducing the overall size and cost of the devices. However, for good localization performance the underlying DoA estimator is of uttermost importance. In this paper, we therefore propose a novel high performance DoA estimator for sectorized antennas that does not require cooperation between the transmitter and the localizing network. The proposed DoA estimator is broadly applicable with different sectorized antenna types and signal waveforms, and has low computational complexity. Using computer simulations, we show that our algorithm approaches the respective Cramer-Rao lower bound for DoA estimation variance if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is moderate to large and also outperforms the existing estimators. Moreover, we also derive analytical error models for the underlying DoA estimation principle considering both free space as well as multipath propagation scenarios. Furthermore, we also address the fusion of the individual DoA estimates into a location estimate using the Stansﬁeld algorithm and study the corresponding localization performance in detail. Finally, we show how to implement the localization in practical systems and demonstrate the achievable performance using indoor RF measurements obtained with practical sectorized antenna units.},

  abstract = {Processing the signals received on an array of sensors for the location of the emitter is of great enough interest to have been treated under many special case assumptions. The general problem considers sensors with arbitrary locations and arbitrary directional characteristics (gain/phase/polarization) in a noise/interference environment of arbitrary covariance matrix. This report is concerned first with the multiple emitter aspect of this problem and second with the generality of solution. A description is given of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which provides asymptotically unbiased estimates of 1) number of incident wavefronts present; 2) directions of arrival (DOA) (or emitter locations); 3) strengths and cross correlations among the incident waveforms; 4) noise/interference strength. Examples and comparisons with methods based on maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum entropy (ME), as well as conventional beamforming are included. An example of its use as a multiple frequency estimator operating on time series is included.},

  abstract = {Utilizing artificial noise (AN) is a good means to guarantee security against eavesdropping in a multi-input multi-output system, where the AN is designed to lie in the null space of the legitimate receiver's channel direction information (CDI). However, imperfect CDI will lead to noise leakage at the legitimate receiver and cause significant loss in the achievable secrecy rate. In this paper, we consider a delayed feedback system, and investigate the impact of delayed CDI on security by using a transmit beamforming and AN scheme. By exploiting the Gauss-Markov fading spectrum to model the feedback delay, we derive a closed-form expression of the upper bound on the secrecy rate loss, where Nt = 2. For a moderate number of antennas where Nt $>$; 2, two special cases, based on the first-order statistics of the noise leakage and large number theory, are explored to approximate the respective upper bounds. In addition, to maintain a constant signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio degradation, we analyze the corresponding delay constraint. Furthermore, based on the obtained closed-form expression of the lower bound on the achievable secrecy rate, we investigate an optimal power allocation strategy between the information signal and the AN. The analytical and numerical results obtained based on first-order statistics can be regarded as a good approximation of the capacity that can be achieved at the legitimate receiver with a certain number of antennas, Nt. In addition, for a given delay, we show that optimal power allocation is not sensitive to the number of antennas in a high signal-to-noise ratio regime. The simulation results further indicate that the achievable secrecy rate with optimal power allocation can be improved significantly as compared to that with fixed power allocation. In addition, as the delay increases, the ratio of power allocated to the AN should be decreased to reduce the secrecy rate degradation.},
