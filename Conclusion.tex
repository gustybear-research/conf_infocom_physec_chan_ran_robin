\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we propose an orthogonal blinding based secret transmission scheme, which is resistant to  known-plaintext attack by leveraging reconfigurable antennas  to rapidly randomize the channel state during transmission. We propose a compressive sensing based AoD estimation algorithm and  predict Alice-Bob  channel under  arbitrary antenna modes. We formally analyze the secrecy leakage using conditional mutual information, which is applicable to both single and multi-antenna eavesdroppers. We show that the secrecy leakage decreases with less channel correlation created by  artificial    channel randomization. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world experiments to evaluate its performance. Results show that, the communication quality between Alice and Bob remains acceptable, whereas the randomized channel can successfully prevent Eve from   launching the known-plaintext attack even if all the historical symbols are known. In the future, we will study other better practical alternatives to orthogonal blinding and analyze the security using secrecy capacity based notions.
